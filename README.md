## About
This library is all about helping with the common little problems like having a type of object to inherit from with an internal data storage to turn to a json or array, ... 

## Usage
A lot of examples on how to use the classes can be found in the UnitTests. The whole collection is extensively tested and therefore quite stable.
Feel free to contribute, suggest changes or help make it better.
